# ðŸš€ Project Board Migration Complete!

## âœ… New Collaborative Project Created

**New Project URL**: https://github.com/users/jeremyeder/projects/4

### Key Improvements:
- **PUBLIC Visibility**: Any collaborator (human or AI) can access!
- **Same Features**: All time tracking fields, quality gates, sprint management
- **All Issues Migrated**: 41 issues successfully added to new project
- **Better Naming**: "kubectl-ld: GPU Heartbeat & SLO Convergence"

### What Changed:
1. Created new public project (#4) with clear kubectl-ld association
2. Added all 5 comprehensive fields (Effort Hours, Actual Hours, Story Points, Work Type, Day Assigned)
3. Migrated all 41 issues from old project
4. Updated documentation references

### For Collaborators:
- **Humans**: Can now find and access the project immediately
- **Other AIs**: Will see the project when working in the kubectl-ld repo
- **Permissions**: Anyone with repo access can view/contribute
- **Discovery**: Clear naming shows it's for kubectl-ld

### GitHub's Project Model:
- **Projects v2**: Are user/organization-level (not repository-level)
- **Repository Projects Tab**: Only shows deprecated Projects v1
- **Best Practice**: Use public user-level projects with clear naming
- **Collaboration**: Public visibility enables team workflows

### Next Steps:
1. Archive old project #3 to avoid confusion
2. Share new project URL with any collaborators
3. Continue development with full collaborative visibility!

The project is now properly set up for collaboration with any human or AI working on kubectl-ld!
