# - Simple issue templates
# - Basic progress tracking
```

### Custom Sprint Duration
```bash
# Create 5-day sprint project
/project:setup sprint 5

# Creates Day1-Day5 assignment options
# Optimized for shorter development cycles
```

## Integration Examples

### With Existing Repositories
```bash
# In existing repo with issues
cd my-existing-project
/project:setup

# Adds project management to existing codebase
# Preserves existing issues and history
# Creates project board linking to existing issues
```

### With CI/CD Pipelines
The automated GitHub Actions integrate with existing CI/CD:

```yaml
# Existing CI can trigger progress updates
- name: Update Project Progress
  if: success()
  run: |
    gh workflow run progress-tracker.yml
```

### With Multiple Teams
```bash
# Team A: Feature development
/project:setup sprint 7

# Team B: Research and innovation  
/project:setup research

# Team C: Documentation and training
/project:setup minimal

# Each team gets optimized workflow for their needs
```

## Success Stories

- **Collaboration**: Structured workflow improved team coordination
- **Predictability**: Accurate estimates and delivery confidence

## Best Practices

### Before Running Command
1. **Repository Setup**: Ensure GitHub CLI is authenticated
2. **Planning**: Define project scope and duration
3. **Team Alignment**: Agree on workflow and processes
4. **Tool Access**: Verify GitHub project permissions

### After Setup
1. **Team Training**: Review collaboration documentation
2. **Issue Creation**: Use templates for consistent quality
3. **Progress Tracking**: Regular updates in issue comments  
4. **Retrospectives**: Use metrics for continuous improvement

### Ongoing Management
1. **Daily Standup**: Review project board together
2. **Sprint Planning**: Use story points for estimation
3. **Progress Reports**: Leverage automated dashboards
4. **Quality Gates**: Enforce test requirements strictly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Errors**
```bash
# Ensure proper GitHub permissions
gh auth refresh -s project,write:org
```

**Project Creation Fails**
```bash
# Check organization vs personal repo
gh repo view --json owner
```

**Missing Fields**
```bash
# Re-run field creation manually
gh api graphql -f query='...'
```

### Validation Steps
1. **Project Board**: Verify all columns and fields created
2. **Labels**: Check comprehensive label system applied
3. **Templates**: Confirm issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
4. **Actions**: Verify GitHub Actions workflow active
5. **Documentation**: Review collaboration guide and dashboard

## Migration Guide

### From Manual Process
1. **Export Issues**: Use GitHub export if needed
2. **Run Setup**: Execute `/project:setup` command
3. **Organize Issues**: Move to appropriate project columns
4. **Set Estimates**: Add story points and effort hours
5. **Begin Tracking**: Start using automated workflow

### From Other Tools
1. **Issue Migration**: Import issues to GitHub first
2. **Workflow Setup**: Run `/project:setup` for automation
3. **Team Training**: Adopt new collaboration processes
4. **Data Mapping**: Map existing metrics to new fields
5. **Process Evolution**: Iterate and improve over time
