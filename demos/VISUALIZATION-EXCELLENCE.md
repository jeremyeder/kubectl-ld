## üìÅ Files

### Demo Execution
- `integrated_visualization_demo.py` - **Main demo script** (complete 60-second showcase)
- `visualization-excellence.tape` - **VHS terminal recording** for automated demo generation

### Documentation
- `VISUALIZATION-EXCELLENCE.md` - **This file** (demo overview and usage guide)

## üöÄ Running the Demo

### Interactive Demo (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the complete integrated demonstration
python3 demos/integrated_visualization_demo.py
```

This runs a **60-second interactive demo** showing all four visualization components in sequence with professional timing and transitions.

### VHS Recording Generation
```bash
# Generate automated terminal recording (requires VHS)
vhs demos/visualization-excellence.tape
```

This creates `demos/visualization-excellence.gif` and `demos/visualization-excellence.mp4` for sharing.

### Individual Component Demos
```bash
# GPU Heartbeat Animation only
python3 -c "
from mtop.heartbeat_visualizer import create_demo_scenario
animator, heartbeat = create_demo_scenario()
animator.run_live_animation(heartbeat, duration_seconds=30.0)
"

# Executive Dashboard only  
python3 -c "
from mtop.executive_view import create_demo_executive_view
dashboard, heartbeat = create_demo_executive_view()
dashboard.run_live_dashboard(heartbeat, duration_seconds=30.0)
"

# Real-time Integration only
python3 -c "
from mtop.real_time_updates import create_demo_real_time_system
viz_manager, heartbeat = create_demo_real_time_system()
viz_manager.start_real_time_updates(heartbeat)
import time; time.sleep(30); viz_manager.stop_real_time_updates()
"
```
