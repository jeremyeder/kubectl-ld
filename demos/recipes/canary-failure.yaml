# Environment configuration
environment:
  mode: "mock"
  config: "production-config.json"
  topology: "enterprise"
  rollout: "canary"

# Override specific settings for failure scenario
overrides:
  MTOP_WORKLOAD_BASELINE_QPS: 300
  MTOP_SLO_ERROR_RATE_PERCENT: 1.0     # Normal error tolerance
  MTOP_WORKLOAD_SPIKE_MULTIPLIER: 3.0  # Simulate traffic spikes

# Models to showcase (old vs new version)
models:
  primary: "gpt-4-turbo"      # Stable version
  canary: "llama-3-70b-instruct"  # New version being tested
