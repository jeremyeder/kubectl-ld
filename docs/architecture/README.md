## üéØ Documentation Purpose

### For "Life with llm-d" Book
- Provides technical foundation for book chapters
- Demonstrates real-world LLM infrastructure architecture
- Shows enterprise-grade monitoring system design

### For Technical Readers
- Understanding system design principles
- Learning LLM monitoring best practices
- Implementing similar systems

### For Contributors
- Onboarding new developers
- Maintaining architectural consistency
- Making informed design decisions

## üìê Architectural Principles

### Core Principles
1. **Modularity** - Clean separation of concerns
2. **Extensibility** - Plugin-based architecture for new features
3. **Observability** - Comprehensive monitoring and debugging
4. **Performance** - Efficient real-time monitoring
5. **Reliability** - Fault-tolerant and self-healing

### LLM-Specific Considerations
- **Token Efficiency** - Optimized for LLM workload patterns
- **GPU Awareness** - Deep integration with GPU monitoring
- **Cost Optimization** - Built-in cost tracking and optimization
- **SLO Management** - Real-time SLO compliance monitoring
