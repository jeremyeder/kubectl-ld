## üõ°Ô∏è Security Principles

### Core Security Principles
1. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege** - Minimal required permissions
3. **Zero Trust** - Verify everything, trust nothing
4. **Secure by Default** - Security built into default configurations
5. **Transparency** - Clear security posture and audit trails

### LLM-Specific Security
- **Model Protection** - Securing LLM model artifacts and weights
- **Prompt Injection Defense** - Protection against prompt manipulation
- **Data Leakage Prevention** - Preventing training data exposure
- **Resource Abuse Prevention** - Protecting against resource exhaustion

## üîê Security Features

### Built-in Security
- **Kubernetes RBAC Integration** - Native Kubernetes security model
- **TLS Everywhere** - Encrypted communication by default
- **Secure Defaults** - Security-first default configurations
- **Audit Logging** - Comprehensive security event logging

### Monitoring Security
- **Real-time Threat Detection** - Automated security monitoring
- **Anomaly Detection** - Unusual behavior identification
- **Security Dashboards** - Security posture visualization
- **Alert Integration** - Security event notification

### Compliance Support
- **Audit Trails** - Complete action audit logs
- **Data Governance** - Controlled data access and retention
- **Compliance Reporting** - Automated compliance status reports
- **Policy Enforcement** - Automated security policy enforcement

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Deployment Security
- **Cluster Hardening** - Kubernetes cluster security best practices
- **Network Segmentation** - Proper network isolation
- **Secrets Management** - Secure credential handling
- **Image Security** - Container image scanning and signing

### Operational Security
- **Access Management** - Regular access review and rotation
- **Patch Management** - Timely security updates
- **Incident Response** - Security incident handling procedures
- **Backup Security** - Secure backup and recovery procedures

### Development Security
- **Secure SDLC** - Security in development lifecycle
- **Code Scanning** - Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Dependency Management** - Third-party security management
- **Security Testing** - Regular penetration testing

## üö® Security Alerts & Monitoring

### Alert Categories
- **Authentication Failures** - Failed login attempts
- **Authorization Violations** - Unauthorized access attempts
- **Data Access Anomalies** - Unusual data access patterns
- **Resource Abuse** - Excessive resource consumption
- **Configuration Changes** - Security-relevant configuration modifications

### Monitoring Integration
- **SIEM Integration** - Security Information and Event Management
- **Log Analysis** - Security log parsing and correlation
- **Threat Intelligence** - External threat feed integration
- **Automated Response** - Automated security incident response
