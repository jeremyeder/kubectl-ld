# ROI Calculator: mtop Phase 1 Cost Optimization

## Overview

This calculator helps determine customer-specific ROI for mtop Phase 1 deployment based on actual GPU pricing and usage patterns.

## Quick ROI Assessment

### Basic Calculation Formula
```
Annual Savings = (Current GPU Cost - Optimized GPU Cost) × Hours × Models × 365
```

### Example: Single Model Optimization
**Scenario**: Large language model on H100 → A100 optimization

```
Current State:
- GPU Type: H100
- Cost: $5.00/hour
- Usage: 24 hours/day
- Models: 1

Optimized State:
- GPU Type: A100  
- Cost: $3.00/hour
- Usage: 24 hours/day
- Models: 1

Calculation:
- Hourly savings: $5.00 - $3.00 = $2.00
- Daily savings: $2.00 × 24 = $48.00
- Annual savings: $48.00 × 365 = $17,520
```
